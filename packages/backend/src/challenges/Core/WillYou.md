## Challenge

Once Mary heard a famous song, and a line from it stuck in her head. That line was "Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?". Mary believes that a person is loved if and only if he/she is both young and beautiful, but this is quite a depressing thought, so she wants to put her belief to the test.

Knowing whether a person is young, beautiful and loved, find out if they contradict Mary's belief.

A person contradicts Mary's belief if one of the following statements is true:
- they are young and beautiful but not loved;
- they are loved but not young or not beautiful.

### Example

For young = true, beautiful = true, and loved = true, the output should be `solution(young, beautiful, loved) = false`.

Young and beautiful people are loved according to Mary's belief.

For young = true, beautiful = false, and loved = true, the output should be `solution(young, beautiful, loved) = true`.

Mary doesn't believe that not beautiful people can be loved.

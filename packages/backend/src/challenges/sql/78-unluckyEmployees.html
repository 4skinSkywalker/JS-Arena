<h2>Unlucky Employees</h2>

<p>
    Your company has fallen on hard times, and you have to let some of your employees go. You figure it will be easier
    to fire an entire department all at once, so now you want to determine which department it's going to be.
</p>

<p>
    Information about your employees and departments is stored in two tables, <strong>Employee</strong> and
    <strong>Department</strong>, respectively. Here are their structures:
</p>

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Department</strong>:
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
            <li class="list-group-item">id: unique department id</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">name: department name</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Employee</strong>:
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
            <li class="list-group-item">id: unique employee id</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">full_name: employee's full name</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">department: foreign key referencing <code>Department.id</code></li>
            <li class="list-group-item">salary: employee's salary</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    To choose the unfortunate department, you set a number of criteria: you are willing to get rid of any department
    that has no more than <code>5</code> employees. Among these smaller departments, you will consider those where the
    total salary of all its employees is maximal. Lastly, to make a tough situation more fair, you decide to make the
    final choice from the remaining departments at random. Thus, you'd like to build the following table of departments:
</p>

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item">select all departments with less than <code>6</code> employees;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">sort these departments by the total salary of its workers in descending order (in the case of a tie, the
        department with the greatest number of employees should go first; if it's still not enough to break a tie, the
        department with the smallest <code>id</code> should go first);</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">cross out the departments at the even rows and leave only those in the odd positions, to consider them more
        thoroughly afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Given tables <strong>Employee</strong> and <strong>Department</strong>, build a table as described below. The
    resulting table should have columns <code>dep_name</code>, <code>emp_number</code> and <code>total_salary</code> and
    be sorted as described above.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Table <strong>Department</strong>:</p>
<table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>id</th>
            <th>name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>IT</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>HR</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Sales</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Table <strong>Employee</strong>:</p>
<table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>id</th>
            <th>full_name</th>
            <th>salary</th>

            <td>James Smith</td>
            <td>20</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>John Johnson</td>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Robert Jones</td>
            <td>15</td>
            <td>1</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Mary Troppins</td>
            <td>17</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>Penny Old</td>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>Richard Young</td>
            <td>17</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>Drew Rich</td>
            <td>50</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Expected output table:</p>
<table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>dep_name</th>
            <th>emp_number</th>
            <th>total_salary</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>IT</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>80</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HR</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>31</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    All three departments have <code>5</code> or fewer employees, so they are all candidates to be fired. When sorted in
    descending order by <code>total_salary</code>, the <code>Sales</code> department becomes the second (i.e. is located
    at an even row), so it's not present in the resulting table.

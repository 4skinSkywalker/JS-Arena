<h1>Personal Hobbies</h1>
<div>
    <p>You've been looking for new friends on the Internet. You just came across a cool website that helps people all
        over the world become friends by suggesting perfect friend candidates based on the information in users'
        profiles.</p>
    <p>The system suggested some people for you to reach out to, and you're ready to make a move. However, you don't
        want to exercise your communication skills in vain, which is why prior to contacting a person you want to make
        sure you'll have something in common to talk about.</p>
    <p>You downloaded the list of suggested people and saved it in the <strong>people_hobbies</strong> table, which has
        the following structure:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>name</code> - the unique person's name;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>hobbies</code> - a list of hobbies the person has.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given the <strong>people_hobbies</strong> table, your goal is to return the sorted names of people who have
        <em>sports</em> or <em>reading</em>, but not both, in their list of <code>hobbies</code>.</p>

<h1>Important Events</h1>
<div>
    <p>You're very busy and have a lot of important events coming up. In order to ensure that you don't forget any of
        these events, you have decided to organize them.</p>
    <p>The information about your events is stored in the table <strong>events</strong>, which has the structure:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>id</code>: unique event id;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>name</code>: the event name;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>event_date</code>: the event date in the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>participants</code>: the number of people that are going to attend this event.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After some thinking, you decide that it would be easier to navigate though your schedule if you could see all the
        events ordered by the weekday on which they are scheduled. In order to do so, you want to sort all the events by
        the weekdays of their <code>event_date</code>s, meaning that Monday events should come first, Tuesday events
        should come next, and so on, with Sunday events coming last. In the case of a tie, the <code>participants</code>
        should be a tie-breaker; an event with the largest number of <code>participants</code> should go first, because
        events with more attendees are more important. It is guaranteed that there are no events that have the same
        <code>event_date</code> and the same number of <code>participants</code>.</p>
    <p>Given the table <strong>events</strong>, sort it as described above and return the resulting table.</p>
    
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>You can use <code>EXTRACT(DOW FROM event_date::date -1)</code> function to extract the day of the week from the <code>event_date</code> field, -1 is used to turn monday into the smallest value (otherwise it would be sunday).</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>For the following table <strong>events</strong></p>
    <table class="table table-striped my-3">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>id</th>

                <th>event_date</th>
                <th>participants</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>

    <p><code>Meeting</code> and <code>Comic-con</code> are both scheduled for Tuesdays, but <code>Meeting</code> is more
        important because its <code>participants</code> number is bigger. <code>Christmas</code> is scheduled for
        Saturday and <code>Dinner</code> is scheduled for Sunday.</p>

    You work at a small startup company that only has a handful of employees.
    Since the company is so small, some of the employees have to work in several
    departments at once. Because of this, information about groups of employees
    that work in the same departments is stored in two separate tables,
    <strong>departments</strong> and <strong>employees</strong>. The tables are
    structured as follows:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <strong>departments</strong>:
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <code>dep_name</code>: the unique department name;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <strong>employees</strong>:
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <code>emp_name</code>: the employee's unique first name and surname.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Given the tables <strong>departments</strong> and
    <strong>employees</strong>, you have to prepare a report about company
    employees and the departments in which they work. To do this, you simply
    combine the rows of the two tables, then sort the resulting rows first by
    the departments' names and then by the employees' names.
  </p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>For the following tables <strong>departments</strong></p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>dep_name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>IT</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>PD</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>and <strong>employees</strong>:</p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>emp_name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Donald Cole</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>James Richard</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>John Tucker</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>the output should be</p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>dep_name</th>
        <th>emp_name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>IT</td>
        <td>Donald Cole</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>IT</td>
        <td>James Richard</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>IT</td>
        <td>John Tucker</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>PD</td>
        <td>Donald Cole</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>PD</td>
        <td>James Richard</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>PD</td>
        <td>John Tucker</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

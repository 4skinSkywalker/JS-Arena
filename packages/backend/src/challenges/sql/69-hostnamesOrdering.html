<p>
    Yesterday you wrote down the links for some resources that you are going to use as references
    in your academic paper, and now you want to sort them. You didn't bother to write down the
    entire link for any of them, so all you have is a bunch of unique hostnames.
</p>

<p>
    You stored the information about these hostnames in the table <strong>hostnames</strong>,
    which has the structure:
</p>

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>id</strong>: the unique hostname id;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>hostname</strong>: the unique hostname.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Each hostname contains several domains and can be written in the format
    <code>hostname = domain1.domain2...</code>.
    To sort the hostnames, you've decided that hostname <code>A</code> should go before hostname
    <code>B</code> in the sorted list if its reversed list of domains is lexicographically smaller
    than the reversed list of <code>B</code>'s domains.
</p>

<p>
    Given the table <strong>hostnames</strong>, build the resulting table as follows:
    The table should have columns <code>id</code> and <code>hostname</code>, and its values should
    be ordered as described above. It is guaranteed that all the hostnames are different and that
    there are no more than <code>3</code> domains in each hostname.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>For the following table <strong>hostnames</strong>:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>id</th>
            <th>hostname</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>workbench.mysql.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>codesignal.slack.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>codesignal.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>snarknews.info</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>sololearn.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>dev.mysql.com</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>id</th>
            <th>hostname</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>codesignal.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>dev.mysql.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>workbench.mysql.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>codesignal.slack.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>sololearn.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>snarknews.info</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

    You returned from vacation with a huge suitcase full of presents.
    Unfortunately, you forgot the correct combination for the combination lock
    on the bag, and now you have to try all of them until you find the correct
    one. You're curious about how many possible combinations the lock has.
  </p>
  <p>
    The combination lock consists of several rotating discs, where each disc has
    its own set of possible characters. You have a table
    <strong>discs</strong> which stores the information about these discs and
    has the following structure:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item"><code>id</code>: the unique ID of a disc;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>characters</code>: the list of characters the disc has (the
      characters are guaranteed to be unique);
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><code>color</code>: the color of the disc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Calculate the total number of all possible combinations that the lock has,
    and return it as a table that has only one column
    <code>combinations</code> and one row.
  </p>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <p>
    You can use <code>EXP(SUM(LN(column_name)))</code> to calculate the product
    of all the values in a column.
  </p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>For the following table <strong>discs</strong></p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>characters</th>
        <th>color</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>code</td>
        <td>blue</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>fights</td>
        <td>white</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>the output should be</p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>combinations</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>24</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    The set of possible characters for the first disc is equal to
    <code>4</code>, and the set for the second disc is <code>6</code>, so the
    total number of combinations is <code>4 * 6 = 24</code>.
  </p>

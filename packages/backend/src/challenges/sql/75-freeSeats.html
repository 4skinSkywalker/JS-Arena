<p>
  You're working on the tech support team of an airline company, and your boss
  has asked you to implement a feature that shows the number of available seats
  on every flight.
</p>

<p>
  Information about the airline is stored in three tables -
  <strong>flights</strong>, <strong>planes</strong>, and
  <strong>purchases</strong>, respectively. The tables are structured as
  follows:
</p>

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <strong>flights</strong>:
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
      <li class="list-group-item">flight_id: the unique flight id;</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        plane_id: the id of the plane making the flight.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <strong>planes</strong>:
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
      <li class="list-group-item">plane_id: the unique plane id;</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        number_of_seats: the number of seats on the plane.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <strong>purchases</strong>:
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
      <li class="list-group-item">flight_id: the flight id of the purchase;</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">seat_no: the seat number of the purchase.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is guaranteed that in the <strong>purchases</strong> table, the pairs
  <code>(flight_id, seat_no)</code> are unique.
</p>

<p>
  With the information provided in the database, you need to calculate the
  number of seats that are not yet purchased for each <code>flight_id</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Given tables <strong>flights</strong>, <strong>planes</strong>, and
  <strong>purchases</strong>, build a table as follows: The resulting table
  should have columns <code>flight_id</code> and <code>free_seats</code>, where
  for each <code>flight_id</code>, <code>free_seats</code> is the number of
  seats that have not been purchased yet. The rows of the table should be
  ordered by <code>flight_id</code> in ascending order. It is guaranteed that
  the information in table <strong>purchases</strong> is consistent and there
  are no purchases for non-existing <code>flight_id</code>s or
  <code>seat_no</code>s.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>For the following table <strong>flights</strong>:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>flight_id</th>
      <th>plane_id</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>111</td>
      <td>128</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>87</td>
      <td>157</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>121</td>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Table <strong>planes</strong>:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>plane_id</th>
      <th>number_of_seats</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>128</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>23</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>157</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>239</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Table <strong>purchases</strong>:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>flight_id</th>
      <th>seat_no</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>111</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>87</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>87</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>flight_id</th>
      <th>free_seats</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>87</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>111</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>121</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

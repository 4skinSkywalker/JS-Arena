    The company you work for has a database with the IP addresses of all the
    company's computers in it. When a new computer is purchased, an employee
    adds its IPv4 address to this database. Unfortunately, you've just
    discovered that there is no address validation, so some of the records are
    incorrect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now your boss wants you to write a program that will find and retain only
    the correct records from this table. A record is correct if the IP it
    contains is a valid IPv4 address, and either the first or the second
    component in the <strong>host part</strong> is a two-digit number.
  </p>
  <p>The <strong>ips</strong> table contains the following columns:</p>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>id</code>: the unique ID of the computer;
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>ip</code>: the unique IP address of the computer.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your task is to create a new table that contains only the correct records
    from the given <strong>ips</strong> table. This table should be sorted by
    <code>id</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>For the given table <strong>ips</strong></p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>ip</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>"1.1.1.1"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>"1.111.111.11"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>"11.11.11.11"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>"11.11.11.11.11.11"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>"11.11.11.111"</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>the output should be</p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>ip</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>"11.11.11.11"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>"1.111.111.11"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>"11.11.11.111"</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

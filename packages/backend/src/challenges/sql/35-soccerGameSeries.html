    You have a table <strong>scores</strong> that contains information about a
    series of soccer games. Your goal is to determine the winner of the series.
    A team is declared the winner if it won more games than the other team. If
    both teams had the same number of wins, then the winner is determined by the
    better goal difference (the difference between the goals that a team scores
    and the goals that the opposing team scores on them over all the games). If
    the goal differences are equal, the winner is the team that scored more
    goals during away games (i.e. games when it was not the host team). The
    result is the index of the winning team. If the above criteria are not
    sufficient for determining the winner, return <code>0</code>.
  </p>
  <p>The <strong>scores</strong> table contains the following columns:</p>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>match_id</code> - the unique ID of the match;
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>goals_home</code> - the score of the team that plays at home;
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>goals_away</code> - the score of the team that plays away;
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>team_home</code> - the id of the team that plays at home. This value can be either '1' or '2'.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your task is to return a new table with a single column
    <code>winner_team</code>, which can contain <code>'1'</code>,
    <code>'2'</code>, or <code>'0'</code>.

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>For given table <strong>scores</strong></p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>match_id</th>
        <th>goals_home</th>
        <th>goals_away</th>
        <th>team_home</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>'1'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>'2'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>'1'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>'2'</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>the output should be</p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>winner_team</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>'1'</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
      <li class="list-group-item">Team 1 won the first game.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Team 2 won the second game.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Team 2 won the third game.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Team 2 won the fourth game.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Team 1 scored 6 goals, 2 of which away.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Team 2 scored 8 goals, 4 of which away.</li>
    </ul>
    Therefore, team 2 won the series.

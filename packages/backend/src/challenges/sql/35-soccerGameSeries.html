    <p>You have a table <strong>scores</strong> that contains information about a series of soccer games. Your goal is
        to determine the winner of the series. A team is declared the winner if it won more games than the other team.
        If both teams had the same number of wins, then the winner is determined by the better goal difference (the
        difference between the goals that a team scores and the goals that the opposing team scores on them over all the
        games). If the goal differences are equal, the winner is the team that scored more goals during away games (i.e.
        games when it was not the host team). The result is the index of the winning team. If the above criteria are not
        sufficient for determining the winner, return <code>0</code>.</p>
    <p>The <strong>scores</strong> table contains the following columns:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>match_id</code> - the unique ID of the match;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>team_1_score</code> - the score of the team with id '1';</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>team_2_score</code> - the score of the team with id '2';</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>match_host</code> - the id of the team that hosted the game (plays at home). This value can be either '1' or '2'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your task is to return a new table with a single column <code>winner_team</code>, which can contain <code>'1'</code>,
        <code>'2'</code>, or <code>'0'</code>.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>For given table <strong>scores</strong></p>
    <table class="table table-striped my-3">

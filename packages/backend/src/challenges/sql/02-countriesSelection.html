    Your friend wants to become a professional tour guide and travel all around
    the world. In pursuit of this dream, she enrolled in tour guide school. The
    professors in this school turned out to be very demanding, and one of them
    gave your friend a difficult assignment that she has to finish over the
    weekend.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's the assignment: Given a list of countries, your friend should
    identify all the countries that are in Africa. To help her, you have decided
    to write a function that will find all such countries from any set of
    countries. The <strong>countries</strong> table in which the countries are
    stored has the following structure:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item"><code>name</code>: the name of the country;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>continent</code>: the continent on which the country is situated;
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>population</code>: the country's population.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Return a new table that has the same columns, but that only
    contains the countries from Africa. The countries should be sorted
    alphabetically by their names.
  </p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>For the following table <strong>countries</strong></p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>name</th>
        <th>continent</th>
        <th>population</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Austria</td>
        <td>Europe</td>
        <td>8767919</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Belize</td>
        <td>North America</td>
        <td>375909</td>
      </tr>

        <td>Africa</td>
        <td>22709892</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

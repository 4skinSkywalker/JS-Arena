    Your company is planning to expand internationally very soon. You have been
    tasked with preparing a report on foreign markets and potential competitors.
  </p>
  <p>
    After some investigation, you've created a database containing a
    <strong>foreignCompetitors</strong> table, which has the following
    structure:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>competitor</code>: the name of the competitor;
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>country</code>: the country in which the competitor is operating.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Given the <strong>foreignCompetitors</strong> table, compose the resulting
    table with two columns: <code>country</code> and <code>competitors</code>.
    The first column should contain the country name, and the second column
    should contain the number of competitors in this country. The table should
    be sorted by the country names in <em>ascending</em> order. In addition, it
    should have an extra row at the bottom with the summary, as described above.
  </p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>For the following table <strong>foreignCompetitors</strong></p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>competitor</th>
        <th>country</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Acme Corp</td>
        <td>USA</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>GLOBEX</td>
        <td>USA</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Openmedia</td>
        <td>France</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>K-bam</td>
        <td>USA</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hatdrill</td>
        <td>UK</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hexgreen</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Faxla</td>
        <td>Spain</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>the output should be</p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>country</th>
        <th>competitors</th>

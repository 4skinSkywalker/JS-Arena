<div>
  <p>You recently attended an event and noticed that your USB drive is missing. You are certain that you still had the drive before this most recent event, so you must have lost it at one of the events you attended earlier.</p>
  <p>You remember having the USB drive within the last 7 days, so the event where you lost it must have occurred within the 7 days immediately preceding your most recent event.</p>
  <p>
    The list of events you've attended (including the most recent one) is stored
    in a table called <strong>Events</strong>. It has three columns:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>id</code>: the unique id of the event;
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><code>name</code>: the name of the event;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <code>event_date</code>: the date of the event.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Task</h3>
  <p>
    Return all events that meet the following conditions:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item">They occurred <strong>before</strong> the most recent event.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">They took place within the <strong>7-day period immediately preceding</strong> the most recent event date.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">The most recent event itself must <strong>not</strong> be included.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The result should contain the columns <strong>name</strong> and <strong>event_date</strong>,
    and should be sorted by <strong>event_date</strong> in descending order.
  </p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>For the following table <strong>Events</strong></p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>name</th>
        <th>event_date</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>TGIF</td>
        <td>'2016-11-18'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>TGIF</td>
        <td>'2016-11-11'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Weekly team meeting</td>
        <td>'2016-11-07'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Weekly team meeting</td>
        <td>'2016-11-14'</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>the output should be</p>
  <table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>name</th>
        <th>event_date</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Weekly team meeting</td>
        <td>'2016-11-14'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>TGIF</td>
        <td>'2016-11-11'</td>
      </tr>

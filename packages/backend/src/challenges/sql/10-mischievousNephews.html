    <p>Your nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie are staying with you over the winter holidays. Ever since they arrived,
        you've hardly had a day go by without some kind of incident - the little rascals do whatever they please!
        Actually, you're not even mad; the ideas they come up with are pretty amazing, and it looks like there's even a
        system to their mischief.</p>
    <p>You decided to track and analyze their behavior, so you created the <strong>mischief</strong> table in your local
        database. The table has the following columns:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>mischief_date</code>: the date of the mischief (of the <code>date</code>
            type);</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>author</code>: the nephew who caused the mischief (<code>"Huey"</code>,
            <code>"Dewey"</code> or
            <code>"Louie"</code>);
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>title</code>: the title of the mischief.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It looks like each of your nephews is active on a specific day of the week. You decide to check your theory by
        creating another table as follows:<br>
        The resulting table should contain four columns, <code>weekday</code>, <code>mischief_date</code>,
        <code>author</code>, and <code>title</code>, where <code>weekday</code> is the weekday of
        <code>mischief_date</code> (<code>0</code> for Sunday, <code>1</code> for Monday, and so on). The table should
        be sorted by the <code>weekday</code> column, and for each
        <code>weekday</code> Huey's mischief should go first, Dewey's should go next, and Louie's should go last. In
        case of a tie, <code>mischief_date</code> should be a tie-breaker. If there's still a tie, the record with the
        lexicographically smallest
        <code>title</code> should go first.
    </p>
    <p>It is guaranteed that all entries of <strong>mischief</strong> are unique.</p>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>You can use <code>EXTRACT(DOW FROM mischief_date::DATE)</code> to extract the day of the week from the
        <code>mischief_date</code> column. Here, <code>::DATE</code> is a type cast, converting
        <code>mischief_date</code> from text to a date type.</p>

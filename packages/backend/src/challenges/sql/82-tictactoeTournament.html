<p>
    The latest Tic-Tac-Toe World Championship has just concluded. It was a big
    success and attracted a lot of participants! Now everyone is waiting for
    the results. As a member of the judging committee, you've been tasked with
    creating a championship leaderboard.
</p>

<p>
    The results of all the tic-tac-toe matches are stored in the
    <strong>results</strong> table, which has the following structure:
</p>

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>timestamp</strong>: the date and time of the game;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>name_naughts</strong>: the name of the player that played with naughts (<code>O</code>);</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>name_crosses</strong>: the name of the player that played with crosses (<code>X</code>);</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>board</strong>: the state of the tic-tac-toe board at the end of the game.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The <code>board</code> is a string of <code>9</code> characters that represent
    the state of board's <code>9</code> cells at the end of the match.
    The first <code>3</code> characters represent the first (upper) row,
    the second <code>3</code> characters represent the second row, etc.
    The character is <code>O</code> if the respective board cell contained
    a naught, <code>X</code> if it contained a cross, or <code>.</code> if
    the cell was empty at the end of the game.
</p>

<p>For example, this board</p>

<pre><code> | |O
 |O| 
X|X|X</code></pre>

<p>
    is represented by the string <code>..O.O.XXX</code>.
</p>

<p>
    It is guaranteed that the opposing players have different names.
    It's also guaranteed that each <code>board</code> represents a valid
    terminal state for a tic-tac-toe game, meaning that either of the players
    wins or it's a draw.
</p>

<p>
    Players are awarded points based on their performance:
</p>

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item"><code>2</code> points for each game they win</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><code>1</code> point for a draw</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><code>0</code> points if they lose</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Create a leaderboard with the following format:
</p>

<p>
    Given the <strong>results</strong> table, compose a results table that has
    the following six columns:
    <code>name</code>, <code>points</code>, <code>played</code>,
    <code>won</code>, <code>draw</code>, and <code>lost</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The table should be sorted in descending order by the <code>points</code>,
    then in ascending order by the total number of <code>played</code> games,
    then in descending order by the number of victories, and then in ascending
    order by player <code>name</code>s.
</p>

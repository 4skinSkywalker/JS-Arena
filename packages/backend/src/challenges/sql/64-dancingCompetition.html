<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    During the dance contest, each judge evaluates the dancers' performances
    based on three criteria, using a score from <code>1</code> to
    <code>10</code> for each of the criteria. You are given a table of the
    <code>scores</code> awarded to a specific dancer by each judge. Recently,
    the dance contest made the decision to drop scores awarded by a certain
    judge if that judge gave an extreme (either minimum or maximum) score for
    at least two criteria.
</p>

<p>
    For example, if the judge awarded one of the minimum scores for musicality
    (i.e., there may be similar scores for musicality, but there may not be
    smaller scores for that criterion) and one of the maximum scores for
    floorcraft, all three of the scores given by that judge should not be taken
    into account.
</p>

<p>
    Return a table that consists of only the scores that should be considered
    after this filtering, sorted by <code>arbiter_id</code>.
</p>

<p>The <strong>scores</strong> table contains the following columns:</p>

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>arbiter_id</strong> – the unique ID of the judge;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>first_criterion</strong> – the score given for the first criterion;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>second_criterion</strong> – the score given for the second criterion;</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>third_criterion</strong> – the score given for the third criterion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>For the following table <strong>scores</strong>:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>arbiter_id</th>
            <th>first_criterion</th>
            <th>second_criterion</th>
            <th>third_criterion</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>arbiter_id</th>
            <th>first_criterion</th>

<p>
    The first judge gave the maximal scores for the second and third criteria,
    so his scores aren't included in the answer. The fifth judge's given scores
    are all minimal, so her scores aren't included in the answer either.

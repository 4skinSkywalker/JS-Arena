    <p>You are the chairman of your university's drawing club, which isn't doing very well right now. The club meets two
        times a week to exchange drawing advice, talk about new techniques, and draw something together. But the members
        are starting to get bored during these meetings, so you've decided to add an additional activity to the routine.
    </p>
    <p>In order to do this, you decided to collect information about the students, which is now stored in the table
        <strong>people_interests</strong>, which has the following columns:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>name</code> - the unique name of a person;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>interests</code> - the set of interests or hobbies this person has, given as a comma-joined string.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information gave you the idea that reading might be an interesting theme for the next meeting, so you
        announced that the next meeting will be reading-related. Now you're interested in the number of members that
        will come.</p>
    <p>Given the <strong>people_interests</strong> table, find the people who will attend the next meeting, i.e. those
        who are fond of both drawing and reading. The resulting table should consist of a single <code>name</code>
        column, and the records should be sorted by people's names.</p>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>STRING_TO_ARRAY(interests, ',')</code> can be used to turn a column into an array.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>value = ANY(array)</code> can be used to check if any item of an array is equal to a given value.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>For given table <strong>people_interests</strong></p>
    <table class="table table-striped my-3">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>name</th>
                <th>interests</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>August</td>
                <td>cooking,juggling</td>

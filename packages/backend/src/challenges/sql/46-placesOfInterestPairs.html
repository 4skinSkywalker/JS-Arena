<h1>Places Of InterestPairs</h1>
<div>
    <p>You're going on vacation in a big city, and you've prepared a list of all the sights you'd like to visit. As you
        don't have much time and can't spend a whole day at one interesting place, you want to visit several sights per
        day and walk from one site to another. But walking a long distance might be boring, so you won't walk between
        two places if the distance between them is <code>5</code> km or more.</p>
    <p>To find the route that you should take, you are going to find all pairs of places that are less than
        <code>5</code> km from each other.</p>
    <p>The places of interests are stored in a table <strong>sights</strong>, which has the following attributes:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>id</code>: the unique ID of the place;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>name</code>: the name of the place;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>x</code>: the x coordinate of the place;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>y</code>: the y coordinate of the place.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The distance between the places is calculated with the assumption that they are just points on a 2D map.</p>
    <p>Given the <strong>sights</strong> table, find all pairs of places that are less than <code>5</code> km from each
        other and return them as a table with the columns <code>place1</code> and <code>place2</code>. Sort them in
        lexicographical order. The places in the pairs should also be sorted lexicographically.</p>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>You can <code>JOIN</code> the table to itself to find all pairs of places that are less than <code>5</code> km from each other. Use a condition with &lt; or &gt; in the <code>ON</code> clause to avoid the same pair being returned twice.</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>For the following table <strong>sights</strong></p>

    <p>You've just started working for a large and successful company, and it's come as a shock to find that the records
        about the company's internal organization haven't been updated for ages. Some employees have changed their
        departments and some have resigned, and consequently, there are some departments that have no employees in them.
        You want to identify these departments.</p>
    <p>Information about employees and departments is stored in two tables, <strong>employees</strong> and
        <strong>departments</strong>, which have the following structure:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>employees</strong>:
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>id</code>: the unique employee ID;</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>full_name</code>: the employee's full name;</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>department</code>: a foreign key referencing <code>departments.id</code>;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>departments</strong>:
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>id</code>: the unique department ID;</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>dep_name</code>: the department name.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given the tables <strong>employees</strong> and <strong>departments</strong>, build a table with only one column,
        <code>dep_name</code>, which contains all the departments in which there are no employees, sorted by
        <code>id</code>.</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>For the following tables <strong>departments</strong></p>
    <table class="table table-striped my-3">
        <thead>
            <tr>

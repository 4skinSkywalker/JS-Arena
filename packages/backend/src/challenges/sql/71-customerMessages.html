<p>
  You recently added feedback functionality to the small web service you own.
  You were able to handle everything manually at first, but the amount of
  messages you receive now is overwhelming. As such, you've decided to start
  generating generic responses automatically.
</p>

<p>
  All customer names are stored in the table <strong>customers</strong> with the
  following structure:
</p>

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>id</strong>: unique customer id;</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <strong>name</strong>: the name of the customer in the format described
    below.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The customer's <code>name</code> is stored in the following format:
  <code>&lt;first name&gt; &lt;last name&gt;</code> (two words separated by a
  single space), where first and last names can contain both uppercase and
  lowercase English letters.
</p>

<p>
  Your task is to write a function that, given the customer's <code>name</code>,
  will return the following message:
</p>

<pre>
Dear &lt;Firstname&gt; &lt;Lastname&gt;! We received your message and will process it as soon as possible. Thanks for using our service. FooBar On! - FooBarIO team.
        </pre
>

<p>
  Here, <code>&lt;Firstname&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Lastname&gt;</code> are the
  first and the last names of the customer, with the first letter in uppercase
  and all other letters in lowercase.
</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>
  You can use <code>UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(...))</code> to split the name into
  first and last names into multiple rows.
</p>
<p>
  You can use <code>STRING_AGG(...)</code> to concatenate the first and last
  names from multiple rows back into a single name in a single row.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>For the following table <strong>customers</strong>:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>id</th>
      <th>name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>JOHN GaLT</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>SANDY COHEN</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<table class="table table-striped my-3">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>id</th>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>response</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>JOHN GaLT</td>
      <td>
        Dear John Galt! We received your message and will process it as soon as
        possible. Thanks for using our service. FooBar On! - FooBarIO team.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>SANDY COHEN</td>
      <td>
        Dear Sandy Cohen! We received your message and will process it as soon
        as possible. Thanks for using our service. FooBar On! - FooBarIO team.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

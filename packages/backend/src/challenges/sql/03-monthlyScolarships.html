<h1>Monthly Scholarships</h1>
<div>
	<p>Students at your university get scholarships that are paid out throughout the year.</p>
	<p>
		Information about the scholarships is stored in the table <strong>scholarships</strong>, which
		has the structure:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
		<li class="list-group-item"><code>id</code>: the unique student id;</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">
			<code>scholarship</code>: the amount of the annual scholarship the student has been awarded.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Now you need to calculate the amount of money each student should get per month. Given the table
		<strong>scholarships</strong>, build the resulting table as follows: The table should have the
		same columns as the initial table, but the <code>scholarship</code> column should contain the
		amount of the student's monthly scholarship payout. The rows should be ordered by the students'
		<code>id</code>s.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Example</h3>
	<p>For the following table <strong>scholarships</strong></p>
	<table class="table table-striped my-3">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>id</th>
                <th>scholarship</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>12000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>18000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>24000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>15000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>21000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6</td>
				<td>13000</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>the output should be</p>
	<table class="table table-striped my-3">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>id</th>
                <th>scholarship</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>1000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>1500</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>2000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>1250</td>

			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>1750</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6</td>

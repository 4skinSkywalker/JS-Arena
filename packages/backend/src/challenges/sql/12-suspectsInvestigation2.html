    <p>A large amount of money was stolen today from the main city bank, and as the chief of police it's your duty to
        find the robber.</p>
    <p>You store information about your suspects in the table <strong>Suspect</strong>, which has the structure:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>id</code>: unique suspect id;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>name</code>: suspect first name;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>surname</code>: suspect surname;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>height</code>: suspect height;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>weight</code>: suspect weight.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You have already gathered some evidence and discovered the following clues:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item">according to the camera records, the robber is taller than <code>170cm</code>;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">the robber left their signature near the crime scene: <code>"B. Gre?n"</code>. <code>"B"</code> definitely
            stands for the first letter of robber's name, and <code>"Gre?n"</code> is their surname. The
            <code>4<sup>th</sup></code> letter of the surname is smudged by ketchup and is unreadable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The clues you've obtained allow you to let some suspects go since they can't possibly be guilty, so now you need
        to build a list that contains the people who can be freed based on the gathered information. For each of these
        people, you need to know his/her <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and <code>surname</code>. Please note that
        the information obtained from the clue should be considered case-insensitive, so for example
        <code>"bill Green"</code>, <code>"Bill GrEeN"</code>, and <code>"Bill Green"</code> should all be included in
        the new table.</p>
    <p>Given the table <strong>Suspect</strong>, build the resulting table as follows: the table should have columns
        <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and <code>surname</code> and its values should be ordered by the suspects'
        <code>id</code>s in ascending order.</p>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>You can use the <code>ILIKE</code> function to filter out suspects who can't possibly be guilty according to the information</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>For the following table of <strong>Suspect</strong></p>

    <p>The <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> and the <code>2<sup>nd</sup></code> suspects are not taller than
        <code>170cm</code>, and the <code>4<sup>th</sup></code> suspect's surname doesn't match the <code>"Gre?n"</code>
        pattern, so these suspects can't be guilty.</p>

<h1>Courses Distribution</h1>
<div>
    <p>You work with a professor of applied mathematics and informatics to create and distribute this year's plan of
        courses for students.<br>
        You were almost finished when you noticed that a couple of fixes yet need to be done. There are courses which
        names' are marked as <code>'-toremove'</code>, so you decided to remove them permanently. Prior to removing
        them, you'd like to make sure that deleting a course would also remove it from all the related tables
        automatically.</p>
    <p>All courses are stored in <strong>courses</strong> table that has the following structure:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>id</code>: unique id of the course;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>name</code>: unique name of the course that may end with
            <code>'-toremove'</code>, which means that
            the course is about to be removed;</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><code>description</code>: description of the course.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are also <strong>groupcourses</strong> and <strong>groupexams</strong> tables which represent courses
        assigned to groups and examination dates of courses for each group, respectively. Here are their structures:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>groupcourses</strong>:
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>group_id</code>: group id;</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>course_id</code>: course id;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>groupexams</strong>:
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>date</code>: the date of the exam;</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>group_id</code>: id of the group taking the exam;</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>course_id</code>: id of the course.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given <strong>courses</strong>, <strong>groupcourses</strong> and <strong>groupexams</strong> tables you need to
        properly set up foreign keys, so that after a record is deleted from the <strong>courses</strong> table, records
        that correspond to the deleted course are also deleted from <strong>groupcourses</strong> and
        <strong>groupexams</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Your task is to concatenate the results from two tables, <strong>groupcourses</strong> and <strong>groupexams</strong>, each
        containing <strong>group_id</strong> and <strong>course_id</strong> columns. Your goal is to return a unified list of group-course combinations
        from these tables, sorted by <strong>group_id</strong> and <strong>course_id</strong>.</p>

# You are planning to rob houses on a specific street, and you know that every house on the street has a certain amount of money hidden. The only thing stopping you from robbing all of them in one night is that adjacent houses on the street have a connected security system. The system will automatically trigger an alarm if two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night.

# Given a list of non-negative integers nums representing the amount of money hidden in each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob in one night without triggering an alarm.

# Example

# For nums = [1, 1, 1], the output should be
# solution(nums) = 2



def solution(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]
    dp = [0] * len(nums)
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
    for i in range(2, len(nums)):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])
    return dp[-1]

# You are the head zookeeper at a large zoo. You've been contacted by schools in the area that want to bring in classes so that students can feed the animals. The animals can only be fed once a day, so no two classes can come on the same day if they want to feed the same animals.

# You have a list classes, such that classes[i] is a list of animals that the ith class wants to feed. Classes i and j cannot come on the same day if an animal in classes[i] also appears in classes[j] (for i â‰  j). Your job is to determine the minimum number of days you would need to have all the classes come to feed the animals if they can all come within 5 days. If it isn't possible for all the classes to come within 5 days, return -1 instead.

# Example

# For classes = [["Tiger", "Lima", "Frog"], ["Tiger", "Zebra","Lion"], ["Tiger", "Rabbit"], ["Emu", "Zebra", "Rabbit"]], the output should be
# solution(classes) = 3.
# Classes 0, 1, and 2 all want to feed the Tiger, so they have to come on different days. Class 3 cannot come on the same day as class 1 (because of the Zebra) or class 2 (because of the Rabbit), but they can come on the same day as class 0. Therefore it only takes 3 days for all the classes to visit the zoo.

# For classes = [["Tiger", "Lima", "Frog"], ["Tiger", "Zebra", "Lion"], ["Tiger", "Rabbit"], ["Lima", "Zebra", "Rabbit"]], the output should be
# solution(classes) = 4.
# Each class has to come on a separate day, because every pair of classes has at least one animal in common.

# For classes = [["Lion", "Emu"], ["Giraffe", "Peacock"], ["Lima"], ["Tiger", "Cheetah", "Slugs"], ["Snakes", "Sealion"]], the output should be
# solution(classes) = 1.
# No classes have animals in common, so they can all come on the same day.

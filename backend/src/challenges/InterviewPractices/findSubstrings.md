## Code Challenge

You have two arrays of strings, `words` and `parts`. 

Return an array that contains the strings from `words`, modified so that any occurrences of the substrings from `parts` are surrounded by square brackets '`[]`', following these guidelines:
- If several `parts` substrings occur in one string in `words`, choose the longest one. 
- If there is still more than one such part, then choose the one that appears first in the string.

#### Example

For `words` = ["Apple", "Melon", "Orange", "Watermelon"] and `parts` = ["a", "mel", "lon", "el", "An"], 
the output should be `solution(words, parts)` = ["Apple", "Me[lon]", "Or[a]nge", "Water[mel]on"].

While "Watermelon" contains three substrings from the `parts` array, "a", "mel", and "lon", "mel" is the longest substring that appears first in the string.

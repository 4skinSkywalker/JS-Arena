ProProgrammers at Fort Boyard

# Description

After long years of sharpening your programming skills and honing your physique you finally made it: as a member of the ProProgrammers team you've entered Fort Boyard!

Your team has successfully completed several challenges so far, and one of your teammates is ready to face the next one. In this challenge the player must move a barrel from one end of an n × m maze to the other where the key is locked in a vice. A tool that releases the key is connected to the barrel. The maze consists of n · m - 3 boxes, and these boxes and the barrel should be moved so that the key can be freed. The boxes and the barrel are really heavy, so you decided to help your teammate to plan his moves.

Given the size of the maze and boxes positions, find the minimum number of moves required to complete the challenge.

# Example

For n = 3, m = 3, and
boxes = [[0, 2], [2, 2], [1, 0], [2, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1]],
the output should be
solution(n, m, boxes) = 8.

This is how one of the possible solutions looks like:

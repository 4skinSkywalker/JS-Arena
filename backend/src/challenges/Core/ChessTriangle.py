# Consider a bishop, a knight and a rook on an n Ã— m chessboard. They are said to form a triangle if each piece attacks exactly one other piece and is attacked by exactly one piece. Calculate the number of ways to choose positions of the pieces to form a triangle.

# Note that the bishop attacks pieces sharing the common diagonal with it; the rook attacks in horizontal and vertical directions; and, finally, the knight attacks squares which are two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from its position.



# Example

# For n = 2 and m = 3, the output should be
# solution(n, m) = 8.



def solution(n, m):
    return (
        times(n, m, 2, 3)
        + times(n, m, 3, 3)
        + times(n, m, 2, 4)
        + times(n, m, 3, 4)
    )

def times(n, m, x, y):
    return (ways(n, m, x, y) + ways(m, n, x, y)) * 8

def ways(n, m, x, y):
    if n < x or m < y:
        return 0
    return (n - x + 1) * (m - y + 1)

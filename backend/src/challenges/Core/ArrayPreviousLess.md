# Challenge Description

Given array of integers, for each position `i`, search among the previous positions for the last (from the left) position that contains a smaller value. Store this value at position `i` in the answer. If no such value can be found, store `-1` instead.

## Example

For `items = [3, 5, 2, 4, 5]`, the output should be
`solution(items) = [-1, 3, -1, 2, 4]`.

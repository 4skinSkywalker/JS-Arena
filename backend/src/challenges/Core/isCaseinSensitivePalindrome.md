## Challenge Description

Given a string, check if it can become a palindrome through a case change of some (possibly, none) letters.

### Example

- For `inputString = "AaBaa"`, the output should be `solution(inputString) = true`.
"Aabaa" is a palindrome as well as "AABAA", "aaBaa", etc.

- For `inputString = "abac"`, the output should be `solution(inputString) = false`.
All the strings which can be obtained via changing case of some group of letters, i.e. "abac", "Abac", "aBAc" and 13 more, are not palindromes.

  "description": "### MakeArrayConsecutive2\n\nThe challenge is to find the number of statues that are needed to make a consecutive array. You are given an array of distinct integers representing the statues. Statues of different sizes are located on a non-strictly increasing line. In one move, you can change the place of the first and the last statue in the same fashion. A statue is said to be in place if there is no bigger statue to the left and no smaller statue to the right. \n\nInput: An array of distinct integers, each representing the current position of a statue.\nOutput: An integer representing the minimum number of steps needed to make the statues consecutive.\n\nExample:\n\n``` makeArrayConsecutive2([6, 2, 3, 8]) // 3 ```",

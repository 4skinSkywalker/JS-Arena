  "description": "### ArrayMinimumAboveBound\n\nYou are given an array of integers and an integer `b`. Your task is to find the smallest number in the array that is strictly greater than `b`. If there are several numbers which are equal to the smallest number greater than `b` (remember you are looking for the smallest number which is strictly greater), you should return the rightmost of them.\n\nInput: Two parameters: an array of integers as a list and an Integer `b`\nOutput: Returns the smallest number from the array that is strictly more than `b`, as an Integer.\n\nExample:\n\n``` arrayMinimumAboveBound([1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 6], 3) // 4 ```",

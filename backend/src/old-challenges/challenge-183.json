  "description": "### Find Square Side\n\nThe function `findSquareSide(x, y)` takes two arrays `x` and `y` representing the x and y coordinates of the vertices of a square and returns the length of the side of the square. The points are taken in the sequence from the array index, and the first point from the array is picked as a reference to calculate the distances.\n\nInput: Two arrays of integers `x` and `y` representing the coordinates of the vertices of a square. The arrays are of the same length, which is 4.\nOutput: An integer, the length of the side of the square.\n\nExample:\n\n``` findSquareSide([0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]) // 1 ```",

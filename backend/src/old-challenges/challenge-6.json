  "description": "### VisitsOnCircularRoad\n\nYou are in a city that has a circular road with `N` locations numbered from 1 to `N` in clockwise order. The road is one-way and it is possible to move from one location to any other location (possibly passing some locations). The `visitsOrder` gives the order in which you will visit the locations (you start at location 1). You are to determine the minimum total number of locations the car has to pass in order to complete all the visits.\n\nInput: Two arguments: An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing the locations and An array of integers `visitsOrder` (1 ≤ visitsOrder[i] ≤ n).\nOutput: Return an integer. The minimum total number of locations the car has to pass in order to complete all visits.\n\nExample:\n\n``` VisitsOnCircularRoad(4, [1, 3, 2, 3, 1]) // 6 ```",

  "description": "### House Numbers Sum\n\nA boy is walking a long way from school to his home. To make the walk more fun he decides to add up all the numbers of the houses that he passes by during his walk. Unfortunately, not all of the houses have numbers written on them, and on top of that the boy is regularly taking turns to change streets, so the numbers don't always increase.\n\nHe may for example start with to visit at `house number 5`, then go to `house number 1` and so on.\n\nGiven the array of the numbers of the houses on the boy's route, calculate the sum of the numbers until the boy encounters `house number 0` (inclusive).\n\nInput: An array of integers.\nOutput: An integer.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nhouseNumbersSum([5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 5, 0, 2]) // 11\n```",

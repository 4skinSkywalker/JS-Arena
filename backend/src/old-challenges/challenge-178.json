"description": "### Fixed Points Permutation\n\nThis function calculates the number of fixed points in a permutation. A fixed point in a permutation is an element for which value is equal to its index. For example, in the array [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6], 1 and 4 are on their correct indices.\n\nInput: An array of integers representing the permutation.\nOutput: The number of fixed points in the permutation.\n\nExample:\n\n``` fixedPointsPermutation([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]) // 4 ```",

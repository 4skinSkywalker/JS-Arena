You need to count the number of 1s in the binary representations of all the numbers in the array.\n\nInput: Two integers a and b, where a and b are between 0 and 10^5 inclusively.\nOutput: An integer representing the number of 1s in the binary representations of all the numbers between a and b inclusive.\n\nExample:\n\n``` rangeBitCount(2, 7) // 11 ```",

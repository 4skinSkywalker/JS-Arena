  "description": "### RobotPath\n\nA robot, which moves either left, right, up, or down, is on a platform that is a square with sides length 2n+1. The robot starts at the center of the platform and each second it moves one step. Given the robot's path, which is the sequence of its moves, and the size of boundary it can move around, return the coordinates to which the robot arrives.\n\nInput: (1) a string: the series of steps the robot makes. 'U' means up, 'D' means down, 'L' means left, 'R' means right. (2) an integer: the spatial boundary around the robot it can move in.\nOutput: an array: the coordinates of the robot after going through the given steps within the given boundary.\n\nExample:\n\n```js robotPath('LLLLUUUUDR', 2) // [-1, 1] ```",

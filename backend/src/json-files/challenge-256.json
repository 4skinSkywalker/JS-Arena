  "description": "### CaesarBoxCipherEncoding\n\nThis problem is about the Caesar Box (Julius Caesar was the first to write codes). This cipher is a method to decode a message. Write a function `caesarBoxCipherEncoding` that you have to decode an encrypted message. The decryption is done by taking a square root of the message length and a clever way to print out characters.\n\nInput: a string `s` (1 ≤ `s` length ≤ 100).\nOutput: a string - the original decoded message.\n\nExample:\n\n```js caesarBoxCipherEncoding(\"a message\") // \"aea sgmse\" ```",

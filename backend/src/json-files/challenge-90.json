  "description": "### Neighboring Cells\n\nYou are given a matrix with dimensions m x n (where m is number of rows and n is number of columns). The matrix is initialized with zeros. You need to update each cell in the matrix such that it contains the count of neighboring cells. A neighboring cell is one that is adjacent either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.\n\nInput: A two-dimensional array of size m x n, initially filled with zeros.\nOutput: The updated two-dimensional array after each cell has been updated to contain the count of its neighboring cells.\n\nExample:\n\n```js neighboringCells([[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]) // [[2, 3, 2], [3, 4, 3], [2, 3, 2]] ```",

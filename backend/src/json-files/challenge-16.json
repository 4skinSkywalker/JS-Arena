  "description": "### SwitchLights\n\nYou are given an array of integers representing the state of a row of lights. Each integer should be treated as a boolean where 1 represents a light that's on and 0 represents a light that's off.\n\nYour task is to determine the final state of the lights after using the following rules to process them, in this order:\n\n- When a light is turned on, it turns off all the lights to its left.\n- When a light is turned off, there's no effect on the lights to its left.\n\nThe array will be processed from right to left.\n\nInput: An array of integers (0 and 1) representing the initial state of the lights.\nOutput: An array of integers representing the final state of the lights.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nswitchLights([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) // returns [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nswitchLights([0, 0]) // returns [0, 0]\n```",

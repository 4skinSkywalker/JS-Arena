  "description": "### Solar System Ballistics\n\nThis problem deals with calculating the distance a projectile would travel when launched from the surface of various celestial bodies in the solar system. The inputs are the celestial body to launch from, the launch angle (in degrees), and the initial velocity of the projectile. The output is the distance the projectile would travel.\n\nInput: Name of the celestial body (string), angle of launch (integer), initial velocity (integer).\nOutput: Distance the projectile would travel (float) in the same units as the initial velocity.\n\nExample:\n\n```js solarSystemBallistics('Earth', 45, 100) // 1020.4068 ```",

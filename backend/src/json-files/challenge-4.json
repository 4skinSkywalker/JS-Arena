Every minute, the amount of water in each tube decreases by the amount of its flow rate. The job is to determine how long your water tubes will take to empty out.\n\nInput: Takes two array of integers: water representing the amount of water in each tube, and flowPerMinute representing the flow rate of each tube\nOutput: Returns an integer representing the number of minutes it will take for all the tubes to be out of water.\n\nExample:\n\n```js int actualOutput = waterTubes(int[] {1, 2, 3}, int[] {1, 1, 2}); // 2 ```",

  "description": "### Replace Middle\n\nWe define the middle of the array arr as follows:\n- if arr contains an odd number of elements, its middle is the element whose index number is the same when counting from the beginning of the array and from its end;\n- if arr contains an even number of elements, its middle is the sum of the two elements whose index numbers when counting from the beginning and from the end of the array differ by one.\nGiven array arr, your task is to find its \"middle\" and replace it with arr[0] + arr[1] if arr has an even length. Otherwise, return arr unchanged.\n\nInput: An integer array arr, with size varying from 1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 10^5, and -10^4 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4.\nOutput: An integer array, with its middle number replaced (if the initial array was of even length).\n\nExample:\n\n```js replaceMiddle([7, 2, 2, 5, 10, 7]) // [7, 2, 7, 10, 7] ```",

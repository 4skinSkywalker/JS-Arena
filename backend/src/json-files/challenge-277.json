  "description": "### AppleBoxes\n\nYou have k apple boxes full of apples. Each square box of size m, where 1 <= m <= k, contains m*m apples. You just noticed two interesting properties about the boxes:\n\nThe smallest box is size 1 and contains 1 apple.\nThe difference between the number of apples in the square boxes of odd and even size can be negative because the boxes are not necessarily kept in increasing order.\n\nGiven an integer k, find the difference between the number of apples in the square boxes of odd and even size.\n\nInput: A single integer k that represents the size of the square boxes (1 <= k <= 40).\nOutput: A single integer d that represents the difference between the number of apples in the square boxes of odd and even size.\n\nExample:\n\n```js appleBoxes(5) // -15 ```",

To reach the next level your XP should be at least at threshold. If you kill the monster in the next fight, you will gain reward XP.\n\nInput: Three integers representing the current XP (experience), the XP needed for the next level (threshold), and the XP earned from killing a monster (reward).\nOutput: A boolean indicating if the total experience after gaining reward XP is enough to reach the next level.\n\nExample:\n\n```js reachNextLevel(10, 15, 5) // true ```",

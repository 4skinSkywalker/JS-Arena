  "description": "### neighbouringElements\n\nThis problem requires you to determine the number of neighbouring elements in a 2D array that share the same value. It will iteratively compare each element with its down and right adjacent element, incrementing a counter whenever a match is found.\n\nInput: a 2D array\nOutput: A single integer that represents the total number of neighbouring pairs that share the same value.\n\nExample:\n\n```js neighbouringElements([[1,1,1], [1,1,1], [1,1,1]]) // 12 ```",
